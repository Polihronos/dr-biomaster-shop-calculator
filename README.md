# sv

Everything you need to build a Svelte project, powered by [`sv`](https://github.com/sveltejs/cli).

## Creating a project

If you're seeing this, you've probably already done this step. Congrats!

```sh
# create a new project
npx sv create my-app
```

To recreate this project with the same configuration:

```sh
# recreate this project
npx sv@0.16.1 create --template minimal --types ts --install npm shop-calculator
```

## Developing

Once you've created a project and installed dependencies with `npm install` (or `pnpm install` or `yarn`), start a development server:

```sh
npm run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
npm run dev -- --open
```

## Building

To create a production version of your app:

```sh
npm run build
```

You can preview the production build with `npm run preview`.

> To deploy your app, you may need to install an [adapter](https://svelte.dev/docs/kit/adapters) for your target environment.

## Automatic product sync

GitHub Actions checks the complete Dr Biomaster catalogue once per day, independently of any local computer. If products, prices, sale status, descriptions, links, or images changed, it validates the generated catalogue, commits only `src/lib/products.ts`, and deploys the validated site to GitHub Pages.

The workflow can also be run manually from the repository's **Actions** tab. Failed runs do not publish partial catalogue data and can be retried without changing the website.
